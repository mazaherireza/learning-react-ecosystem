Adding Lazy Loading
-------------------
... let's say we wanna load BlogPage lazily, ... only when we need it.
The code for BlogPage and all the code referenced by this page ... should only be loaded when we need it.

... first of all ... remove this import (import BlogPage, { loader as postsLoader } from ...) ...
... as a next step we have to re-add it, but in a way that it's only loaded when it's needed.

App.jsx
-------
...
  {
    index: true,
    element: <BlogPage />,
    loader: () => import() <--------- ... it will import something dynamically, only when it's needed.

... import gives you a promise ... this is an asynchronous process, ... the loaded file ...
loader: () => import("./pages/Blog").then(module => module.loader())  

... the next step ... load the BlogPage component lazily.

const BlogPage = () => import("./pages/Blog"); <-------- ... this alone won't do the trick 
                                                         ... because this here is not a valid functional component
                                                         A function is only a valid component if it returns JSX code ...
... import actually yields a promise.
To solve this problem, React gives us a special function which we have to wrap around this function ... lazy function 

import { lazy, Suspense } from "react";
...
const BlogPage = lazy(() => import ("./pages/Blog")); <---------- ... lazy takes this function with the dynamic import as an argument.
... now BlogPage can be used as a component. 

{
  index: true,
  element: <BlogPost />, <-------- ... it will still take some time to load the code for this component 
...                                ... you must wrap this with another component ... 

...
  {
    index: true,
    element: <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading ...</p>}><BlogPage /></Suspense>,
    ...

... Suspense ... can be used by other components to wait for content to be loaded before actually rendering the content.

Network
-------
...
... this JS file was downloaded dynamically because we added lazy loading.
... includes the code for the loader and for the BlogPage component.

... we can also implement lazy loading for the individual blog posts ...
