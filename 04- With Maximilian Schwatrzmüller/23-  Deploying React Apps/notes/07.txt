Server-side Routing & Required Configuration
--------------------------------------------
... configuring our project for deployment ...

... actually when you have you application deployed on a server and a user enters a URL in the browser,
... the browsers sends a request to the server ...
... if we didn't just send a request to main domain but maybe also to some path like "/posts",
... that path also reaches the server on this initial request.
... by default, the server would try to find the fitting response for the path we requested ...
... it doesn't have any server side logic for handling requests with different paths. <----------------- **
What the server should instead do is always return exactly the same HTML file and the same JS code so that this path, 
which we requested, can be resolved on the client side ...
