Understanding Lazy Loading
--------------------------
... means that we wanna load certain pieces of code only when it's needed. <------------ *
... to understand lazy loading it's important to understand how this project will be built and served to end users without lazy loading.
... in our various files where we import code from other files ...
... when this component file is evaluated by the browser, code for this hook (useLoaderData) will be imported
in order to handle this component, ...

... when this application is served to end users, all these imports must be resolved before anything's shown on the screen.
... when we later build this application all these imported files will actually be merged together into one big file.

... now the theoretical problem with that is, ... all code files must be loaded before anything's shown on the screen.
...
Having to load all the code initially will slow down that initial page load.
... the idea behind lazy loading is that we load certain components in the end only when they're needed ...
