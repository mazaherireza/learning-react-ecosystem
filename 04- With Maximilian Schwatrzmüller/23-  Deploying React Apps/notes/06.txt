Deployment Example
------------------
Deployment Steps
----------------
Test code
Optimize code
Build app
Upload app

... we built the app for production, let's upload it to a server. ... deploy it.
... a React SPA is a static website.
It consists of only HTML, CSS and JS files and maybe a couple of images, ... all the code will be parsed by the browser ...
therefore, we only need a static site host, we don't need any hosting provider that executes code on the server.

Key Search <-------- Deploy static site

Firebase hosting .... it is a provider that makes hosting static sites pretty easy ...

... install a tool that helps us with uploading our code to the Firebase servers.
TERMINAL
--------
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init <-------- to turn your local project into a project connected to a Firebase project ...
...
firebase deploy
