Why We Need A Special Project Setup
-----------------------------------
... React has some features that are part of React, but that you can't use in evey React project, ...

React features you might not be able to use
-------------------------------------------
React Server Components (RSC)
Server Actions
use() with Promises

Special project setup required!
Not supported by "standard" React projects (e.g created via Vite)

Why is a special setup needed?

Some features require a server-side environment ... not just in the browser.
Code therefore must be split (by the build process / code bundler process)

Client-side code
----------------
Executed on the client-side
Like in most React projects (e.g., created via Vite)

Non Client-side code
---------------------
Executed on the server-side (or during build process) <---------- *
Special project setup required

... one project setup that does support these features would be a NextJS project, ...
