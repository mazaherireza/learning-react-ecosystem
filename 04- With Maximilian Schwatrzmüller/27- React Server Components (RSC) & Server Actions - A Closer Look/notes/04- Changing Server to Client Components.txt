Changing Server to Client Components
------------------------------------
...
... by adding a special directive at the top of the file,
"use client"; <-------- ... will tell the project setup, ... this component should be treated differently, ...
... this will still be executed on the server, but not just there, 
... it is rendered on the server an on the client side.

Why would you not leave it as a server component? <----------- *
What's the advantage of having a client component?
... first let's take a look at the advantage of having a SC.
... less code has to be sent to the client because it's rendered on the server, <-------------- *
hence the client doesn't need to download all the code that's required to render this component.
We can even fetch data on the server ..., which allows us to send finished pages that even include data 
(that has to be fetched) to the client on the initial request instead of performing data fetching in the browser,

... why would you then convert a component to a client component?
Because you might need to use some client component feature ...

React Server Components
-----------------------
React components that are never executed on the client!
Can fetch data & can use async / await
The component is rendered on the server and the result (HTML code) is sent to the client
Special project setup required!
Bundler / build workflow must be configured to support RSC

Client Components
-----------------
Rendered on the server and clinet! <---------------- **
Code does execute on the client-side -> client-side features can be used
Most React projects (e.g., created via Vite) only support client components
In projects that support RSCs, client-components must be marked via "use client" directive
