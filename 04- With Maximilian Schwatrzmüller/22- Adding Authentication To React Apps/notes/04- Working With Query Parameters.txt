Working With Query Parameters
-----------------------------
... we try to login the user, we send a login request to the back-end.
On the other hand, if we're in "Create A New User" mode, we send a request to the back-end that wants to creat a new user.
... we're sending different requests based on which kind of form, we loaded ...

... we could leverage query (search) parameters ...
... is a parameter that's appended in the URL after a question mark. <------------ **
... wanna support a mode query parameter, which is either set to login or to signup
and depending on what it's set to we wanna load a different version of that form.
So it's the same route, the path is always "/auth" 
but we get this extra parameter which defines how extactly this component should be rendered.

... an advantage of using query parameters, ... we can directly link to this page in Signup or Login mode. <----- **
... we can link a user directly to the Signup page, even though it's ... the same page just with a different UI being rendered.

... manage mode with query parameters ...
 
AuthForm.jsx
------------
...
import { Form, Link, useSearchParams } from "react-router-dom";
... query parameters are officially called search parameters. <--------- **

const AuthForm = () => {
  const [searcParams] = useSearchParams();
  const isLogin = searchParams.get("mode") === "login";
  ...
  <Link to={`?mode=${isLogin ? "signup" : "login"}`>
    { isLogin ? "Create New User" : "Login" }
