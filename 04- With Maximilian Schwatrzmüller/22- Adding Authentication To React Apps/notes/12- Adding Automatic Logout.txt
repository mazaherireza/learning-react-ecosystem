Adding Automatic Logout
-----------------------
... we always stay logged in if we got that token once.
It's nice but unrealistic.
... the back-end creates a token that will acutally expire after one hour.
...
I wanna remove it from local storage so after that one hour, the token should be removed from local storage 
and the UI should update ...

... set a timer whenever the RootLayout is rendered which happens when the application starts

RootLayotu.jsx
--------------
...
const token = useLoaderData();
const submit = useSubmit();

useEffect(() => {
  if(!token) {
    return
  }

  setTimeout(() => { submit(null, { action"/logout", method: "POST"}, TIME_OUT)
  }, [token, submit]

... this solution sitll isn't perfect ...
