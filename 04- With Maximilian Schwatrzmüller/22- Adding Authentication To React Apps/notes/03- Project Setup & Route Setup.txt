Project Setup & Route Setup
---------------------------
... I wanna make sure that we have a way of going to that authentication page ... "/auth" route.

... the auth route should still be part of RootLayout.
I still wanna have that navigation on top of it ...

App.jsx
-------
...
{
  path: "auth", <------------ Relative path
  element: <AuthenticationPage /> 
...
