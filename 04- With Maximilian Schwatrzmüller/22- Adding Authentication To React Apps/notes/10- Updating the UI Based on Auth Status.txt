Updating the UI Based on Auth Status
------------------------------------
... to update the UI based on the existence of the token, 
I wanna make that token, easily available in my entire application (on all routes) ...
I also wanna make sure that the information whether the token exists or not, 
is automatically updated so that if the token would be removed (because we log out), the UI automatically updates.

... I don't just wanna call getToken ... in MainNavigation, ... because this function is only called when this component is re-evaluated, 
but it won't lead to the component being re-evaluated if the token is deleted in the future. <--------- **
... I wanna a more reactive solution. ... React Context ... 

... go to our root route, ... wraps all other routes ...
App.jsx
-------
...
const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <RootLayout />,
    errorElement: <ErrorPage />,
    id: "root",
    loader:  <-------- ... that token would be available through the loaderData of the root route, in all other routes.
    children: ...

The best thing about this, is:
React Router will automatically re-evaluate that, if we ... submit that logout Form. <----------- **
So it will then re-fetch that token and determine that the token doesn't exist ... 
then update all the pages that use that loaderData ...

utils/auth.js
-------------
export const getToken = () => localStorage.getItem("token");

export const loader = () => getToken();

App.jsx
-------
...
  {
    path: "/",
    ...
    id: "root" <----- In order to use data from tokenLoader and easily get access to it, 
    loader: tokenLoader, <-------- ... this will be called whenever a new navigation action occurs ...
    ...
...
... now we can use that loaderData from this root route, in all our other routes.

MainNavigation.jsx
------------------
import { useRouteLoaderData } from "react-router-dom";
...
  const token = useRouteLoaderData("root");
