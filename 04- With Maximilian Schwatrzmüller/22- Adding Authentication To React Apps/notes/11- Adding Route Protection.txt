Adding Route Protection
-----------------------
... we can manually go to "events/new" so we can still reach that form even though we're not supposed to.
... it were be better if we wouldn't be able to reach that from at all, if we're not logged in.
So what we need is some route protection. <----------- **
...
We could utilize a loader.
A loader that simply checks if we have a token and if we don't have a token, redirects us away. <--------- **

/utils/auth.js
--------------
...
export const checkAuthLoader = () => { <----------- Can be used to protect a route.
  const token = getAuthToken();
  if(!token) return redirect("/auth"); <------- ... so that the user is able to log in.
}
We can add this loader to all the routes that need protection

App.jsx
-------
...
{
  path: "edit",
  element: <EditEventPage />,
  action: ...
  loader: checkAuthLoader
}
