How Authentication Works
------------------------
... what exactly authentication means.
Authentication is needed if content should be protected
... certain resources / back-end routes, should not be accessible by everyone.
... must authenticate before this access, is granted ... get permission.

How does our client-side React application get permission from that back-end application running on the server?
... it will all start with sending a request with user credentials (with an e-mail and a password ...) to that back-end server.
... back-end able to validate those credentials or create a new user ...
... if the credentials are valid ... 
... the server will send us back a response that basically gives us permission to access certain protected resources.

Getting Permission
                   Request (with user credentials)
Client (Browser) ---------------------------------------> Server (Back-end)
                 <---------------------------------------
                   Response (access granted: yes/no)

Is that enough?
A "yes" alone is not enough to access protected resources / API endpoints.

... something that can be validated on the server and that proves that we really got permission from the server in the past.
... we can't just attach a yes to future requests that wanna access protected resources because we could fake that.

How does authentication work?
Client and server can't just exchange a "Yes"
Any client could simply send a request to our back-end that "tells" the back-end that we prevoiusly were granted access

... there are two main solutions for that.
We could use server-side sessions or authentication tokens.

Server-side Sessions <--------- popular solution especially for full-stack applicationss
                                where you don't have a decoupled front-end and back-end ...

Store unique identifier on server, send same identifier to client
Client sends identifier along with requests to protected resources
Server can then check if the identifier is valid (=previously issued by server to client)

Working with decoupled back-ends
--------------------------------
Client (Browser) <--------- No persistent connection ----------> Server (Backend) 
Since the back-end "doesn't care about the client", it also doesn't store any client-related data (--> sessions)

Most React apps are SPAs that are served by a server that's decoupled from the back-end
The SPA handles routing (on the client side) and only "talks" to the back-end if it needs data (or needs to change data)

A decoupled back-end is served by different server than the React front-end app
The back-end provides various resources routes with which the client-side app may communicate 
The back-end does not register client-side routing actions or user interactions 
It may theoretically serve multiple, different client-side apps (React apps, mobile apps, etc.)

How does authentication work?

Server-side sessions

Authentication tokens
Create (but not store) "permission" token on server & send it to the client
(which is basically a string that is created according to some algorithm ...)
Client attaches token to the future requests for protected resources
Server can then verify the attached token

auth.js
-------
...
const token createJSONToken(email); <-------- ... it's called JSON Web Token
res.json({ token });
...

Getting Permission
                   Request (with user credentials)
Client (Browser) ---------------------------------------> Server (Back-end)
                 <---------------------------------------
                   Response --> Auth Token <--
... on the client-side, ... we have to store that token, attach it to future outgoing requests, ...
