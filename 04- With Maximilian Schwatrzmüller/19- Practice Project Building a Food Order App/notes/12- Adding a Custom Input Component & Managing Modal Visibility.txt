Adding a Custom Input Component & Managing Modal Visibility
-----------------------------------------------------------
... a type of button, beause since it's inside of a form it would otherwise submit the form, 
... <Button type="button"> ...

App.jsx
-------
...
  <Cart />
  <Checkout /> <----- We should add it to our component tree, ... you see that modal opens up ...
</CartContextProvider>

... closing ... by pressing the escape key, but if you do so you can't re-open it anymore 
... that's happening because when we close the modal by pressing the escape key
the dialog will be closed by the browser but in our app, the progress won't change.

So to make sure that we update our progres state whenever the dialog is closed by pressing the escape key.

Modal.jsx
---------
...
  return createPortal(
    <dialog ref={dialogRef} className={`modal ${className}`} onClose={close}> <--- close event will be emitted by the browser ...
      {children}
    </dialog>,
    document.getElementById("modal")
  );
