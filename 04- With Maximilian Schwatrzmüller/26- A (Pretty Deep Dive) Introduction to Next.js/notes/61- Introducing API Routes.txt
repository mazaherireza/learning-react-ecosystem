Introducing API Routes
----------------------
NextJS makes it easy for us to build an API, together with our front-end React app in the same project.
... NextJS feature called API routes.
... special routes (pages) which don't return HTML code, <----------- **
... accepting incoming HTTP requests, ... POST, PATCH ... with JSON data attached to them
... with them might do whatever you need to do. ... and then return JSON data.

... API routes allow you to build your own API end points as part of the NextJS project.
... will be served by the same server as your NextJS app.

pages/api
---------
... NextJS will pick up any JS files stored in there and turn those files into API routes.
  
... define function which contains server-side code because API routes will only run on the server, never on the client.

... triggered whenever a request is sent to this route:
/api/new-meetup 
... URL of this file and if a request is sent to this URL, it'll trigger the function ...

function handler(req, res) {
  if(req.method === "POST") {
    const { body } = req;
