Handling Errors
---------------
... will handle potential errros that might be generated by your pages and components, ...

... will be rendered by NextJS whenever an error occurs.
... it'll only handle errors that occur in the page that sits in the same folder 
as the error.js file or any nested page or layout.

... on the root level of application to catch any error ... anywhere in any of your pages.

error.js
--------
"user client";

const Error = ({ error }) => {
  return <main> ...
}

... the actual error message will actually be hidden by NextJS <------------- **
so that you can't accidentally expose any information that shouldn't be exposed to your end users.

... error.js must be a client component.
... because NextJS ensures that you can catch any errors with that component, 
including errors that happen on the client side ... after the pages were rendered on the server.
