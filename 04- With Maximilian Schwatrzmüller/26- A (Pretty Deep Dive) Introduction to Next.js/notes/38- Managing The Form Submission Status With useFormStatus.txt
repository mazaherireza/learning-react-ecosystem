Managing The Form Submission Status With useFormStatus
------------------------------------------------------
... it would be nice to get some feedback as a user whilst the data is being submitted 
to see that everything's fine and a request is on its way.

... use another hook provided by React.

share/page.js
-------------
import { useFormStatus } from "react-dom";
...
const status = useFormStatus();

status.pending is true if there is an ongoing request and false otherwise.

... this hook requires a client component in order to work, ...
... but we also might not want to turn this entire page into a client component
just because we wanna conditionally update this button.
In addition, this hook will actually give us the status of a form, if it's inside of that form 
for which it should give us the status.
... inside of some component that's inside of that form.

... add a new component, ...

meals-form-submit.js
--------------------
"use client";

import { useFormStatus } from "react-dom";

const MealsFormSubmit = () => {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus();

  return <button> { pending ? "Submitting ... " : "Share Meal" } </button>
}
