Preparing Paths with getStaticPaths & Working With Fallback Pages
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Server Error
Error: getStaticPaths is required for dynamic SSG pages and is missing for "/[meetupId]".

... getStatciPaths is a function you need to export in a page component file 
if it's a dynamic page and you're using getStaticProps.

... with getStaticProps a page is pre-generated during the build process.
This means that of course NextJS needs to pre-generate all versions of this dynamic page in advance
for all the supported IDs.

... here we need to pre-generate it for all the URLs, 
for all the meetupId values, users might be entering at runtime.

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return { <-------- Where we describe all the dynamic segment values
    fallback: 
    paths: [
      {  
        params: { meetupId: "m1" } <--------- ... fetch your supported IDs from a DB ... generate this array dynamically.
}

... fallback 
This key tells NextJS whether your paths array contains all supported parameter values or just some of them.
... false ... paths contains all supported meetup ID values.
