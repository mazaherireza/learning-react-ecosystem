Adding Server-Side Input Validation
-----------------------------------
... one thing you should typically do, when handling user data and form submissions 
is validate the values you're getting.

... client-side validation isn't enough.
... you should also validate on the server side.

!meal.image || meal.image.size === 0
I wanna check if maybe we don't have an image. ... it's undefined,
or if that image has a size that's equal to zero, ... some kind of invalid file.

... we should propbably set up a specific error page for sharing a meal.

... throwing error ... also means that we destroy the entire input of the user.
So, we throw away everything they entered.
