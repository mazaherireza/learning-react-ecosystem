Adding First Pages
------------------
... index.js file, in this file ... have a standard React component ...

The index.js file will be our route page. <----------- **
So if a request reaches our "domain/", just index.js will be loaded.
... news.js for requests that reach our "domain/news".
... the file name will be used as a path name. <--------------- ***

... by looking at the page source, in addition to file based routing, 
we also already use that built-in server-side rendering feature wihtout any extra setup ...
