Setting Up A SQLite Database
----------------------------
... I wanna set up a basic DB
... I'll stop my developent server with Ctrl + C, ... install a new dependency ...

TERMINAL
--------
npm install better-sqlite3

... this is a package that will allow us to work with a SQL light DB.
... can be used locally, without setting up any extra DB server or any other complex setup needed.

... in order to create a DB and populate it with some dummy data, 
... initdb.js file, ... you should store that file... in your root project directory, ...

... I'll execute this initdb.js file with node

TERMINAL
--------
node initdb.js 

meals.db <----------- SQL Light DB 

... start loading meals from this DB ... how we do that?
