Creating a NextJS Project
-------------------------
... we need a project that comes with NextJS pre-installed & that has a certain structure & setup that's needed by NextJS.

nextjs.org

... command like this: npx create-next-app@latest <--------------- *

TERMINAL
--------
npx create-next-app@latest project-name
...
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) Yes

(... you should confirm the App Router, if asked)

... finally the project is being created, the dependencies are being installed ...

... it is enough if you replace you app folder and your public folder ... as well as your eslintrc.json file.

TERMINAL
--------
npm i
npm run dev
