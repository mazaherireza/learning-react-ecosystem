Using Client Components Efficiently
-----------------------------------
...

main-header.js
--------------
"use client";

import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";
...
  const path = usePathname();
  ...
  <Link href="/meals" className={path.startsWith("/meals") ? styles.active : undefined } ...

... you typically wanna add "use client" as far down the component tree as possible, 
so that you really only turn the components that need to be converted to client components into client components 
... the majority of your components can stay server components and are rendered on the server ...
