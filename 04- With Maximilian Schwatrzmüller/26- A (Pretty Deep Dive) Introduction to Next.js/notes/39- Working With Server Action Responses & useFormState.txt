Working With Server Action Responses & useFormState
---------------------------------------------------
How we can handle validation errors, in a more elegant way? <---------- *
... in server actions, ... you are not limited to redirecting or throwing errors.
... you can also return values. ... response objects to be precise ...

... the shape of this object is totally up to you, ... it's a serializable object,

...
  return {
    message: "Invalid input."
  }

How can we use this response ... where we trigger SA? <----------- **
... with help of another hook,  ... useFormState hook.

share/page.js
-------------
...
import { useFormState } from "react-dom";

... is responsible for managing the state of this component, 
which uses a form that will be submitted with help of server actions. <------------ **

... useFormState needs two arguments.
... the first is the actual server action that should be triggered when the form is submitted,
the second argument ... the initial state of this component, 

const [state, formAction] = useFormState(shareMale, { message: null });
state <--------- the latest response returned by this SA in the end
or this nitial state ({ message: null }) if no response has been received yet.

... formAction ... which we should actually set as a value for action property (on the form)

<form ... action={formAction}>

... state depends on the execution of that SA and its response.

... tweak the shareMeal action ... 

actions.js
----------
...
export async function shareMeal(prevState, formData) {
  ...
