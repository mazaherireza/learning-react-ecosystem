Building For Production & Understanding NextJS Caching
------------------------------------------------------
... everything works fine during development ... but things will change once we move to production.

TERMINAL
--------
npm run build

... build and prepare our NextJS application for production.
It'll give us a project that we could then deploy onto a server.

... you can run that production server and that optimized code, by running npm start. <---------- *
This will start a server, but now not some development server, ... the production server,
... it's serving that optimized code ...

... the meal is missing here. 

Why is this (delay) missing here in production?
Why is this meal we added missing?

NextJS performs some pretty aggressive caching <------------- **
... generates, pre-renders all the pages of your app that can be pre-generated, all non-dynamic pages. <--------- **

... by pre-rendering all these pages, it of course has those pages available,
right from the start, after being deployed.
... NextJS caches those pre-rendered pages so that it's able to serve them to all visitors.

... the downside of this approach, ... it never re-fetches the meals 
... uses those pre-generated pages.

... a problem if the data that's visible on that page, changes ...
