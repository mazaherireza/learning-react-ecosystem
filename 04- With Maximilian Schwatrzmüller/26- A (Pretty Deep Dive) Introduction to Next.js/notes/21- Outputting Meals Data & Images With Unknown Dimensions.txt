Outputting Meals Data & Images With Unknown Dimensions
------------------------------------------------------
...

meal-item.js
------------
import Image from "next/image";
...
  <MealItem {...meal} /> <-------- *

... what's interesting about this component ... the path is constructed dynamically 
with a dynamically injected segment that will be different for every meal 
because we have that dynamic meal details page.

<Link href={`/meals/${slug}`} ... 

... this page with expects a dynamic value ... [mealSlug]

The other interesting thing is this Image component.
<Image src={image} alt={title} fill /> <---------- *
... not be imported manually from the assets folder.
Instead, we'll be working with meals that are stored in a DB
and their images are stored in the public folder.

... this Image component needs to know the underlying width and height of the image that's being output.
So not the width and height you wanna have on the screen <------------ **
but the width and height of the image you're trying to render. <---------- **
...

... we'll load them dynamically from a DB.
... and NextJS won't be able to resolve the width and height of such an image, ...
that's why I added this special fill prop ...

You can use the "fill" prop instead of setting a "width" and "height" 
whenever your have an image when you don't know the dimensions in advance.

An alternative would've been to explicitly set the width and height of the images ...
but the problem is that I don't know in advance ...

... it should simply fill the available space with that image ...

meals-grid.js
-------------
...
  <li key={meal.id}>
    <MealItem {...meal} />
