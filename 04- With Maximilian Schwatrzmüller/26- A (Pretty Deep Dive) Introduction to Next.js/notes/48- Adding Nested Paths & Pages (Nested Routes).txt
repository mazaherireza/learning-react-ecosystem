Adding Nested Paths & Pages (Nested Routes)
-------------------------------------------
... file-based routing system ...

pages/news/index.js
... this page (index.js) would still be loaded by visiting "our-domain.com/news" 
... folders, which you create in your pages folder also act as path segments.
... it does matter though as soon as you start creating nested paths, 

... if we just create files directly in the pages folder, 
we're limited to one segment, the file name.
