Triggering Cache Revalidations
------------------------------
How can we fix this problem of NextJS caching too aggressively?

We need to tell NextJS to throw away its cache or parts of its cache whenever we add a new meal. <---------- **
... there's a built-in method for that, a built-in function provided by NextJS.
A function which I wanna execute in SA, right after saving a meal (before I redirect) ... revalidatePath.

This function tells NextJS to revalidate the cache that belongs to a certain route path.<---------- **

... by default, only that path will be revalidated, no nested paths.

... which means that simply this page for this path will be ravalidated.

actions.js
----------
...
await saveMeal(meal);
revalidatePath("/meals", "layout"); <-------- ... all nested pages would be revalidated as well
redirect("/meals");

... you can pass a second argument ...  and set this to "layout", the default is "page", 
... it's the layout that will be revalidated, ...

... revalidate simply means that NextJS throws away the cache that is associated with those pages.

If you would wanna revalidate all the pages of your entire website, 
revalidatePath("/", "layout"); <-------------- **
