Exploring Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with getServerSideProps
-------------------------------------------------------------
... sometimes even a regular update is not enough.

Sometimes you wanna regenerate this page for every incoming request.
So you wanna pre-generate the page dynamically on the fly after development on the server.

... if that's your goal, there is an alternative to getStaticProps.

... getServerSideProps ...
The difference to getStaticProps is that this function won't run during the build process,
... always on the server after deployment.

export async function getServerSideProps(context) { 
                                                         
  <------- Any code you write here will always run on the server, never in the client.
  const { req, res } = context
}

... you can't set revalidate ... runs for every incoming requests anyways, ...

... you need to wait for your page to be generated on every incoming request.

Which one of two should you use?
getServerSideProps ... guaranteed to run for every request.
... you need to wait for your page to be generated on every incoming request.
