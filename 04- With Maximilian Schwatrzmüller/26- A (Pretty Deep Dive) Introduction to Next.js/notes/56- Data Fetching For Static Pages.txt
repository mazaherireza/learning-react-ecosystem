Data Fetching For Static Pages
------------------------------
Page Pre-Rendering <----------- *

Request --------> /some-route
Good for SEO! <-------- Return pre-rendered page -----------> Hydrate with React code once loaded ----> Page / App is interactive

... if we wanna pre-render a page with data, so that this initially returned HTML code already contains the data,
we need to fine tune this built-in pre-rendering process. ... configure it.

... NextJS gives us two forms of pre-rendering, which we can use for controlling how the pages should be rendered.

Two forms of pre-rendering:
Static Generation
Server-side Rendering

When using static generation, a page component is pre-rendered when you build your application, <---------- **
With static generation, by default, 
your page is not pre-rendered on the fly on the server when a request reaches the server but instead, 
it's pre-rendered when you, as a developer, build your site for production.
That means after it was deployed, that pre-rendered page does not change, at least not by default. <------------- **

... if you need to wait for data, ... add data fetching to a page component,
you can do so by exporting a special function from inside your page component file. <------------- **
... only in component files inside of the pages folder.

... getStaticProps ...

... NextJS executes this function (getStaticProps) during pre-rendering process. <-------------- **
So it won't directly call your component function and use the returned JSX snapshot as HTML content
but it first of all, call getStaticProps before it calls the component function.

... its job is to prepare props for this page. <-------------- **
...

... in getStaticProps, you can also execute any code that would normally only run on a server.
You could access a file system here ... connect to a DB ... this code is executing during the build process ...

export async function getStaticProps() { <-------- ... will never execute on the client-side  
     <------- You always need to return an object here.

  return {
    props: <----------- has to be named props    
    ... will be the props object you receive in your CF                                          
}

... now this is pre-rendered and it now contains the full HTML code ...
