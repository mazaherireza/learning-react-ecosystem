Data Fetching For Static Pages
------------------------------
Page Pre-Rendering

Request --------> /some-route
Good for SEO! <-------- Return pre-rendered page -----------> Hydrate with React code once loaded ----> Page / App is interactive

... if we wanna pre-render a page with data, so that this initially returned HTML code already contains the data,
we need to fine tune this built-in pre-rendering process. ... configure it.

... NextJS gives us to forms of pre-rendering, which we can use for controlling how the pages should be rendered.

Two forms of pre-rendering
Static Generation
Server-side Rendering

... code runs at different points of time.

... when using static generation, a page component is pre-rendered when you build your application, <---------- **
... with static generation, by default, your page is not pre-rendered on the fly on the server,
when a request reaches the server but instead, it's pre-rendered when you as a developer, b
build your site for production.

... if you need to wait for data, ... add data fetching to a page component,
... exporting a special function from your page component file. <------------- **
... only in component files inside of the pages folder.

... NextJS executes this function during pre-rendering process. <-------------- **
So it won't directly call your component function and use the returned JSX snapshot as HTML content
but it first of all, call getStaticProps before it calls the CF.

... its job is to prepate props for this page. <-------------- **
...
export async function getStaticProps() { <-------- ... will never execute on the client-side  
     <------- You always need to return an object here.

  return {
    props: <----------- has to be named props                                              
}

... in getStaticProps, you can also execute any code that would normally only run on a server.
You could access a file system here ... connect to a DB ...
