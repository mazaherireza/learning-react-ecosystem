Don't Store Files Locally On The Filesystem!
--------------------------------------------
Why was that image missing when we added a new meal whilst running this production server?

... public/images ... this folder is available during development, 
but for production, it's actually copied into .next folder ...

... when you deploy your Next project, you technically don't even have to deploy the public folder.

... you should store any files that are generated at run time, 
using extra file storage services like AWS S3.
