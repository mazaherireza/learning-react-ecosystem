Analyzing the Created Project
-----------------------------
... the three important folders for us are pages, public and styles ...

... unlike in a regular React app, you have an index.html file in the public folder 
... in the NextJS app you don't have that.
... NextJS has this built-in pre-rendering and whilst it gives you a SPA, 
that SPA is dynamically pre-rendered when a request reaches the server so that 
you do return an inital page with content.

NextJS allows us to determine when a page should be pre-rendered. <------------ **

... the pages folder will be the most important folder
because that is where we will set up that file based routing, 
... define the different pages that should make up our application ...
