Adding an Image Preview to the Picker
-------------------------------------
... to show a preview of the picked image,
we need to handle the event, that an image was picked 
and then store some state so that we can update this UI
and show a preview as soon as we have an image.

... should be triggered whenever ... input has a new value, 
... whenever the change event on this input is emitted.

... we can get hold of that picked file by using event.target.files and then accessing the first file.

const handleImageChange = (event) => {
  const file = event.target.files[0]
  ...

  ... in order to show it as a preview, I wanna convert it into a data URL,  <------------ **
  which is simply a value that can be used as an input for an image element, 
  so that can be used as a source for an img.
 
  We can generate such a data URL with help of a class built into JS, ...

  const fileReader = new FileReader();

  fileReader.onload = () => { <------------ this function will be triggered b the fileReader
    setPickedImage(fileReader.result);      once ** (readAsDataURL) is done.
  fileReader.readAsDataURL(file) **         can access it by accesssing fileReader.result

fileReader.result <----------- generated URL

... readAsDataURL works in a bit of a strange way,
because it doesn't actually return anything, ...
instead, we get hold of that data URL that's being generated by assigning a value to the onload property
of the fileReader object.
