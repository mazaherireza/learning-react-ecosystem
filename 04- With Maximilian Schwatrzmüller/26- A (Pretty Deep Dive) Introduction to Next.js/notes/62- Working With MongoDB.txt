Working With MongoDB
--------------------
... cloud offering, MongoDB Atlas, ... a fully managed cloud-based MongoDB DB

https://www.mongodb.com/
products > Atlas > Get Started

Create Cluster <------------- *
Deploy your cluster

... the MongoDB DB cluster, which we'll use to connect to, then create our DB in there (store our data in there).
In order to be able to connect to this cluster, there are two things you also have to do (in this MongoDB Atlas console)

Network Access
you have to add your local IP ... so that you local computer is able to send requests to MongoDB 

[NextJS allows us to determine when a page should be pre-rendered.]

Username: rezamazaheri_db_user
Password: 2giXLv2CCUNveUVt

Database Access
you need to create at least one user with any username of your choice 
who has to have read and write access to the DB
... this is a user with which we can connect to this cluster later.

Get connection string <---------- *

Connect to cluster

Connecting with MongoDB Driver
1. Select your driver and version
Driver: Node.js
Version: 6.7 or later

... use the Node.js MongoDB driver to write code in our api route that does send queries to this MongoDB Atlas cluster.

... official MongoDB driver, which makes sending queries to MongoDB easy.

2. Install your driver
Run the following in the command line
npm install mongodb

3. Add your connection string into your application code
Use this connection string in your application

mongodb+srv://rezamazaheri_db_user:<db_password>@cluster0.jzqqra2.mongodb.net/?appName=Cluster0

Replace <db_password> with the password for the rezamazaheri_db_user database user. 
Ensure any option params are URL encoded.

TERMINAL
--------
npm install mongodb

api/new-meetup.js
-----------------
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";

const handler = async (req, res) => {
  ...
  const client = await MongoClient.connect(
    "mongodb+srv://rezamazaheri_db_user:2giXLv2CCUNveUVt@cluster0.jzqqra2.mongodb.net/?appName=meetsup"
  );

  const db = client.db();
  const meetupsCollection = db.collection("meetups");
  const result = await meetupsCollection.insertOne(body);
  console.log(result);

  client.close();

  res.status(201).json({ message: "Meetup Inserted!" });
}

... MongoDB is a NoSQL DB that works with collections full of documents.
Collections would be kind of your tables in a SQL DB and document would be your entries in those tables.

... a single meetup would be a single doucment, 
the overall collection then holds multiple meetup documents.
