More on Static Site Generation (SSG)
------------------------------------
... quit the dev server and run npm run build. 

SSG ... Static Site Generation, ... automatically generated as HTML and JSON,
... used for pre-fetching data once the page turned into a SPA.

... Static Generation that's almost the same.
The only difference is that here we got no initial props ...

... big problem, ... data here could be outdated.
This page, is generated during the build process.
So thereafter, we deploy it. If we then add more meetups to our DB, 
this pre-generated page would not know about them.
... if we don't add any client-side data fetching, we would always just see the outdated meetups ...

... if data does change more ferquently, there is an extra property, 
... revalidate ... when we add this property to the object returned by getStaticProps, 
we unlock a feature called incremental static generation. <---------------- **
... wants a number ... this number is the number of seconds NextJS will wait until it generates this page for an incoming request.

... 
  revalidate: 10
... would be regenerated on the server at least every 10 seconds if there are requests comming in for this page.
