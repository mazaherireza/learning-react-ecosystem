More on Static Site Generation (SSG)
------------------------------------
... quit the dev server and run npm run build. 
This is the build command which you need to run before you deploy your NextJS site.
...
info - Generating static pags (4/4)
...
SSG ... Static Site Generation, ... automatically generated as HTML + JSON (uses getStaticProps)
... used for pre-fetching data, once the page turned into a SPA.

Static ... automatically rendered as static HTML (uses no initial props)
... Static Generation that's almost the same.
The only difference is that here we got no initial props ... we have no initial data that was fetched ...

... let's think about potential problems we could be facing when using getStaticProps.

... big problem, ... data here could be outdated. <--------------- **

index.js
--------
...
const HomePage = (props) => {
  return <MeetupList meetups={props.meetups} />;
};

export async function getStaticProps() {
  return {
    props: {
      meetups: DUMMY_MEETUPS,
    },
  };
}

This page, is generated during the build process.
So thereafter, we deploy it. 
If we then add more meetups to our DB, this pre-generated page would not know about them.
... if we don't add any client-side data fetching, we would always just see the outdated meetups ...

... if data does change more ferquently, there is an extra property, ...
... revalidate ... when we add this property to the object returned by getStaticProps, 
we unlock a feature called ISG (Incremental Static Generation). <---------------- **
revalidate wants a number ... the number of seconds NextJS will wait until it generates this page for an incoming request.

... 
  revalidate: 10

... this page would be regenerated on the server at least every 10 seconds 
(if there are requests comming in for this page).

... you would ensure that your data is never older than 10 seconds.
