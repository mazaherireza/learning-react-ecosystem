How Pre-rendering Works & Which Problem We Face
-----------------------------------------------
... if we wanna send an HTTP request once this page is rendered,
we would typically use the useEffect hook ...

useEffect(() => {
 ... <----------------- **
}, []);

... useEffect executes ** after the CF was executed.
... that means the first time this page component is rendered, loadedMeetups will be an [].
Then this effect function will execute, ... we'll have two component render cycles.
... the first time this component renders, ... []

Becuase of these two render cycles, we have a problem with search engine optimization,

... view page source, ... the actual meetup data is missing.

... these items are missing in the HTML page we fetched from the server,
they are missing because they are only rendered in the second component execution cycle.
But the pre-rendered HTML page, (generated by NextJS automatically) does not wait for this second cycle.
It always takes the result of the first render cycle and returns that as the pre-rendered HTML code.
