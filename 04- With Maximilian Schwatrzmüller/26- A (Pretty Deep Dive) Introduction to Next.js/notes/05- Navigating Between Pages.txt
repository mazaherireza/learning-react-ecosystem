Navigating Between Pages
------------------------
... have a link, to that second page.

NextJS renders pages on the server
Server-side (backend)

Page / HTML content is rendered on the server & sent to the client <----------------- **

Client-sie (frontend)

When we visit a page for the first time, it's rendered on the server, ... <--------------- **
but if we're on a page and we navigate around, by clicking links, NextJS allows us to stay in a SPA 
and updata the UI with help of client-side JS code.

... technically the content of the next page, will still be pre-rendered on the server,
but it will then be updated on the client side. 

Server- & Client-side Working Together
--------------------------------------
The backend executes the server component functions & hence derives the to-be-rendered HTML code
The client-side, receives & renders the to-be-rendered HTML code

page.js
-------
import Link from "next/link"; <------ ... if you have some internal link 
...
  <p>
    <Link href="/about">About US</Link> <--------- *
