Optimizing Images With The NextJS Image Component
-------------------------------------------------
... in NextJS you actually got a better element for outputting images than img element.
... special built-in image component, ... help you output images in a more optimized way.
... by lazy loading images ... simplify the process of setting up responsive images and so on.

main-header.js
--------------
import Image from "next/image";
import logo from "@/assets/logo.png";

...
  <Image src={logo} ... priority /> <------------- ... this object (logo) that's generated by NextJS,
                                                   ... contains useful information that's used under the hood 
                                                   by this Image component to display it in an optimized way.

... add the priority property ... since it will always be visible when this page loads.
... we wanna tell to NextJS and the browser that this image should always be loaded as quickly as possible 
to make sure that we got no unnecessary content shift or flickering when the page loads.
