Throwing Not Found Errors For Individual Meals
----------------------------------------------
... it's possible that a user tries to look for a meal that doesn't exist, 
... it's good that we get some fallback page,
but it's not actually that "An Error Occured" ...

page.js
-------
import { notFound } from "next/navigation";
...
  if(!meal) {
    notFound(); <---- calling this function, will stop this component from executing
  }                   and will show the closest not-found or error page.
