Getting Started with a Custom Image Picker Input Component
----------------------------------------------------------
... the job for this component function, is to output some markup and then also handle the picking process.

image-picker.js
---------------
...
  const imageInputRef = useRef();

  const handlePickClick = () => {
    imageInputRef.current.click();
  };
...
  <input type="file" id="image" accept="image/png, image/jpeg" name={name} ref={imageInputRef} /> <---------- *

<input name="image" ... be important for extracting that uploaded image.

...
  <button className={styles.button} type="button">
    Pick an Image
  </button>
... what I want the button to do is click this input, which is not visible anymore ...
It's still part of the DOM, it's just not visible 
... need to handle clicks on this button and them forward them, to this input.
