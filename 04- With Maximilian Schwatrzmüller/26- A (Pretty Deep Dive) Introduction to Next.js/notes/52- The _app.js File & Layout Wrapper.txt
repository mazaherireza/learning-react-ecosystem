The _app.js File & Layout Wrapper
---------------------------------
... if we have an application with dozens or maybe hundreds of pages wrapping our general layout
around all the page contents, ... that becomes cumbersome,
... that's where _app.js file becomes important. 
... this is kind of your route component. <----------- *

pages/_app.js
-------------
...
... App({ Component, pageProps }) {
... Component is a prop that holds the actual page contents that should be rendered.
... pageProps are specific props our pages might be getting.

Whenever you have some component or some setting that affects all your pages 
you can utilize _app.js file to easily add that without diving into dozens of files individually.
