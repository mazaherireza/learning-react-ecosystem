Revisiting Objects & Classes
----------------------------
... objects ... can be used to group multiple values together.

const user = {
  name: "Reza",
  age: 36
};

I can access individual fields ... dot notation ... this dot is a key to accessing values in an object.
... to get access to a value in an object.

... objects can also store functions, ... methods.

{
  ...
  greet() <---------- Without the function keyword, just the name of the function ...
...
... in a function that belongs to an object, you can also access the properties of this object,
so the other methods and fields that belong to this object, ... this keyword.
...
greet() {
  this.age <--------- *
  ...

... create blueprints by using the special class keyword.

class User {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name; <------ **
    this.age = age
  }
  greet() {
    console.log("Hi!")
  }
}

... use constructor for accepting parameters ....

... store them in properties of the object that will be created based on the class with help of the "this" keyword.

const user = new User("Reza", 36);
