React Projects Use a Build Process
----------------------------------
... in the index.html file, you won't find any script tag.

... noscript tag that shows a fallback messgage if the user has disabled JS in their browser, ...
... so why is this working?

... React projects use a build process, ... the code you write is not the code that gets executed in the browser.
Your code is transformed before it's handed off to the browser.
... this is done with help of a tool that's running in the background.
... see that tool in the package.json file, this file lists all the dependencies of this project, ...

... why does the code need to be transformed?
... two main reasons ...

React projects use a build process 
__________________________________
1.Raw, unprocessed React code won't execute in the browser
JSX is not a default JS feature.

2. The code would not be optimized for production (e.g. not minified)
React projects require a build process that transforms your code
... Vite etc., give you such a build process (no custom setup or tweaking needed)

... Node.js ... in order to work on React projects.
Because Node.js is not just use to install packages with the npm command or to create projects with the npx command 
... used behind the scenes by these tools that are used by that build process that's running behind the scenes.

... to make sure your React code gets transformed.
