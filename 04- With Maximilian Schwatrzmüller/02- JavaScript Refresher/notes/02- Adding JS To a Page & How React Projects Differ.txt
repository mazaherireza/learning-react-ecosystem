Adding JS To a Page & How React Projects Differ
-----------------------------------------------
JS can be executed in many different environments <------------ **

In the browser ... where JS originated. <--------- **
(i.e., as part of websites)
JS code can be included in any website
The code then executes inside the browser 
(i.e., on the machine of the website visitor) <---------------- *

On any computer
(e.g., server-side code)
Thanks to Node.js or Deno, JS code can be executed outside of the browser, too.
The code ... executes directly on the machine.

... React, client-side, front-end browser-based library in its core ...
... JS is not limited to the browser, you can even build mobile apps with JS.

On mobile devices
(e.g., via embedded websites)
With extra technologies like Capacitor or React Native, 
you can build mobile apps based on JS
The code then executes on the mobile device

Adding JS code to a website
... two main options. ... they both include the special script tag, ... 

1) Between <script> tags
...
Can quickly lead to unmaintainable & complex HTML files
Typically only used for very short scripts 

2) Via <script> import
Separates HTML & JS code
Maintaining complex JS-powered apps becomes easier

index.html
----------
...
<script src="/scripts/app.js"></scripts> <-------- **
... the src attribute to point at the file ... that should be imported.
... this file (app.js) would be loaded as part of this webpage, when the webpage is loaded.

... defer ... script will only be executed after the rest of the HTML document has been read and parsed.

Alternatively, you could move the <script> tags to the end of the <body> section.

... type attribute ...
<script src... type="module">></script>
... makes sure that this JS file is treated as a JS module. 
... this unlocks one very important new syntax, the import syntax. <----------- **

... importing script files in the context of building React apps.
because when you're working on a React project, you will almost never add these script tags,
... React projects almost always use a build process ...,
injects these script tags into the HTML code for you.
