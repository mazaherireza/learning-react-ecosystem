Reference VS. Prmitive Values
-----------------------------
... primitives ... we can't edit them ... overwrite ... 
... you can't edit existing values.

... objects ... reference values, 
... in a variable you don't store the value, but instead the address of that value in memory.
... array is stored somewhere in memory, ...

Objects <------------- Reference Values
For objects (and arrays are objects!), the memory address is stored in the variables

The underlying value can be edited without changing that address
The value can therefore be edited without reassining the varaible
