Using Function As Values
------------------------
... you can pass functions as values, to other functions.

... arrow functions never accept a name in front of them, 
they always are created in an anonymous way, ... <--------------- **
... but we can make them non-anonymous by storing them in a constant that has a certain name.

... when you're passing a function to another function, 
... you're not defining it here in place, ... you define it in advance, 
you pass it by just using its name, ... omit ()

... passing functions as values is not limited to built-in functions like setTimeout.
