Passing Custom Arguments To Event Functions
--------------------------------------------
...
we'll need to know which button is clicked.
... handleClick, we might want to accept a parameter, ...

... when just passing handleClick as a value to onClick ... we won't get that identifier 
... control how handleClick will be executed by React.

... 
<TabButton onClick={() => handleClick()} ... this code will not run immediately when this line of code gets parsed.

If you wanna define a function that should be executed upon an event, 
but you also want to control how it's going to be called 
and which arguments are going to be passed to it.
