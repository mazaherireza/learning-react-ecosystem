Managing States & Using Hooks, Core Concept
-------------------------------------------
... we need a way of telling React that we want to update the UI.
... state ... is all about registering variables, that are handled by React
and that are updated with help of a function that's provided by React
that will also tell React that data changed ... cause React to update the UI.

... these special variables, are created with help of a special function ...

... they are technically regular functions ... must only be called 
inside of React component functions or inside of other React hooks.

Rules of Hooks <------------- **
--------------
1) Only call hooks inside of component functions 

function App() {
  const [val, setVal] = useState(0);
}

2) Only call hooks on the top level 
... must not be called in nested code statements (e.g., inside of if-statements)

... useState ... allows us to manage some component specific state 
which is simply some data stored by React, which when changed, will trigger this component function 
to which this hook belongs, to re-execute ...

useState("Default Value") <---- ... use ... when this component is first rendered.

useState() Yields An Array With Two Elements
--------------------------------------------
And it will always be exactly two elements <-------------- **

const stateArray = useState("Please click a button");

Array produced and returned by React's useState() function contains exactly two elements

... this first element will be the actual data we're managing ... the second ... will always be a function
... that can be executed to update this state, ...

Manage State
------------
Manage data & tell React to re-execute a component function via React's useState() hook <----- **

State updates lead to new state values
(as the component function executes again)

... useState(0); <---- Initial state value Stored by React

..., setCounter] <-------- State updating function 
Updates the stored value & "tells" React to re-execute the component function in which useState() was called

const [counter, ... <-------------- Current state value
Provided by React 
May change if the component function is executed again

... with this useState hook, we have a way of telling React 
that this component function must be executed again.

... this constant here will be recreated every time this component function executes, <---------- **
so we don't need to use a variable here.

... React will store and update the actual value which will then be passed on to this constant
when this component function executes again.

... state snapshot, ...

... whilst the UI shows the correct value, we see the old value being printed in the console ... <----------- **
... the state value we had before ... 

When you call this state updating function, React in the end schedules this state update
and it then re-executes this component function.
So therefore the updated value will only be available after this app component function executed again.
