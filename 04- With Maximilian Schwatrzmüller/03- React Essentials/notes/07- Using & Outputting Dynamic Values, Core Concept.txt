Outputting dynamic content in JSX
---------------------------------
Static content
Content that's hardcoded into the JSX code
Can't change at runtime

Dynamic content
Logic that produces the actual value is added to JSX
Content/value is derived at runtime

... {} ... between element tags, ... as a value for an attribute, ... output a dynamic value.

... if-statements, for-loops, function definitions and other block statements are not allowed in {}
only expressions that directly produce a value. <------------------ **
