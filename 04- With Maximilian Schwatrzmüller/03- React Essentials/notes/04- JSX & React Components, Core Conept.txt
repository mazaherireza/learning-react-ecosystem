JSX & React Components, Core Concept
------------------------------------
...index.html file, it only contains some basic markup, ... does not contain the HTML code 
that's responsible for displaying the content we're seeing on the screen,
... React is rendering content on the screen, <--------------- **
... in index.html file  ... load a JS file, it includes index.jsx file.

... App.jsx ... the markup for the content we're seeing on the screen.
... HTML code inside of JS function ... jsx extension ... it is a JS file that uses non-standard JS syntax. <---------- **
      
Describe the target UI with JSX
_______________________________
JavaScript Syntax eXtension
Used to describe & create HTML elements in JS in a declarative way

With React, you write declarative code.
You define the target HTML structure & UI, not the steps to get there!

... not supported by browsers.
React projects come with a build process that transforms JSX code to code that does work in browsers.
(... is transformed by the development server, ...)

... component is really just a JS function.

Component functions must follow two rules <------------ **
_________________________________________
Name starts with uppercase character

The function name must start ...
... PascalCase
... pick a name that describes the UI building block ...

Returns "Renderable" content <---------------- **
The function must return a value that can be rendered (displayed on screen) by React.
