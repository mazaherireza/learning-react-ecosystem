It's All About Components! Core Concept
---------------------------------------
React and its ecosystem ... the concept of working with components ... potentially reusable building blocks ...  
... combine to build the overall UI. 

Components are UI building blocks 
_________________________________
React apps are built by combining components

... key building blocks that make up the overall site or app.

Components are the foundation

Build UIs with components
_________________________
Any website or app can be broken down into smaller building blocks: Components <------------- **
It can therefore also be built by creating & combining such components

Header, Core Concept Items, Interactive Tabs

... components wrap HTML and possibly also CSS code, as well as any related JS logic that might be needed
... together those languages and code pieces define and control a part of the UI.
... split up complex UIs into smaller, more manageable parts ... may also be reused in different places of the UI.

The same component is used multipe times with different input data.

Why Components?
______________

Reusable building blocks
------------------------
Create small building blocks & compose the UI from them.
If needed, reuse a building block in different parts of the UI (e.g. a reusable button)

Related code lives together
---------------------------
Related HTML & JS (and possibly CSS) code is stored together
Since JS influences the output, storing JS + HTML together makes sense.

Separation of Concerns
----------------------
Different components handle different data & logic
Vastly simplifies the process of working on complex apps

Different Components, Different Responsibilities
