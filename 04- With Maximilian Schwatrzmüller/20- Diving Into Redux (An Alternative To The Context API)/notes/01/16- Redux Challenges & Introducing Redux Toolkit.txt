Redux Challenges & Introducing Redux Toolkit
--------------------------------------------
... identify a couple of potential problems we could be facing here if our application would continue to grow.
One potential issue can be our action types. <---------- *
... mistype the identifier ...
... clashing identifier names.
... having some way of defining those identifiers once and then reusing them would be nice.

Another potential problem is the amount of data which we manage ...
The more data we have, the more different pieces of state we have, ...
... that means we need to copy a lot of state when we update the counter ... reducer function gets longer and longer ...

Another potential problem ... is the state immutablility which we have to respect. <------------------- **
