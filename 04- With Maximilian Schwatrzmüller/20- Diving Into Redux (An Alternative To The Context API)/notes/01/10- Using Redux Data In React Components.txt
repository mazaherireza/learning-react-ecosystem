Using Redux Data In React Components
------------------------------------
Let's say we wanna utilize this provided store ... in the Counter component ...
... we need to get access to our Redux store and to the data in there.

... there also is useStore hook, ... gives us direct access to the store ... useSelector is a bit more convenient to use ...
... useSelector, allows us to automatically select a part of our state managed by the store.
If we would be using a class-based component ... there also is a connect function which you could use instead.
... can be used as a wrapper around our class component to connect that class component to the store. <--------- *

Counter.jsx
-----------
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";

const counter = useSelector(state => state.counter) <------------ ... a function which will be executed by React-Redux 
...
  <span>{counter}</span>

... when we use useSelector, React-Redux will automatically, set up a subscription to the Redux store for this component.
So your component will be updated and will receive the latest counter automaticlaly whenever that data changes in the Redux store.
... changes to the Redux store will cause this component function to be re-executed. <-------------- **
So you always have the latest counter. 

If you ever unmount this component ... (removed from the DOM) React-Redux would also automatically clear the subscription for you.
It manages that subscription for you behind the scenes.

... how we can change that data? <---------- *
