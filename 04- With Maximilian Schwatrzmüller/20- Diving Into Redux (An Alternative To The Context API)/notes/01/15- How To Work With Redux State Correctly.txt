--------------------------------------

... will not be merged with the existing state. <------------ **
They will override the existing state.

We must always set all the other states when we update a piece of state because we override the old state.

... you should never mutate the existing state.
... always override it by returning a brand new state object.

... objects and arrays are reference values in JS, it's easy to accidentally override and change the existing state.
