Adding State Slices
-------------------
TERMINAL
--------
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit

... uninstall redux (the Redux library itself) because that is already included in Redux Toolkit.

store/index.js
--------------
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
...
createSlice({ <-------- We're preparing a slice of our global state
  name: "Counter",
  initialState,
  reducers: { <--------------- A map ... of all the reducers this slice needs, 
    increment(state) { <-------- Will automatically receive the latest state
      state.counter++ <--------------- we are allowed to mutate state
    },
    decrement() {},
    increase(state, action) {
      state.counter = state.counter + action.amount
    },
    toggleCounter() {} <-------- These methods will automatically be called for you, depending on which action was triggered. 
  }                             
})

... when we have different pieces of state which are not directly related,
we could create different slices (potentially also in different files) to make our code maintainable.

We still must not manipulate the existing state but the good thing is, when using Redux Toolkit and its functions like createSlice, 
we can't accidentally manipulate the existing state.
... Redux Toolkit internally uses another package, ... which will automatically clone the existing state, 
create a new state object, ... in an immutable way. 

... can still have reducers that listen to actions that have an extra payload, ...

How do we now make our store aware of this slice? <------------- **
