Connecting Redux Toolkit State
------------------------------
store/index.js
--------------
import { createSlice, legacy_createStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

...
const store = legacy_createStore(counterSlice.reducer); <-------------- **

... to create our store, we could pass our counterSlice.reducer ... we get access to the reducers, set up in the slice ...
... we couldn't dispatch actions right now, ...

If we have bigger applications with multiple state slices, we would face a problem if we try to do it like this,
... there can only be one reducer passed to createStore, when we have multiple slices, ...
... with standard Redux, there is a combineReducers function ... 
... import another function from Redux Toolkit which will make that a bit easier ... configureStore 
... makes merging multiple reducers into one reducer easier thereafter.

configureStore({
  reducer <------------- Redux wants one main reducer function which is responsible for the golbal state.

reducer: { counter: counterSlice.reducer <---- A map of reducers 

... if we had multiple state slices ... as the value for this reducer key, 
we could also set an object and in that object, we can set up any keys of our choice, 
and the values of those properties would then be different reducer functions.
...
reducer: { counter: counterSlice.reducer, ... }

How do we dispatch actions? <----------- **
