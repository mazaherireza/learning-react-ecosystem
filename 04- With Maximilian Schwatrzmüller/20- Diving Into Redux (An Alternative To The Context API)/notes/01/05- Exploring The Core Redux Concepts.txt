Exploring The Core Redux Concepts
---------------------------------
... we'll execute this file with NodeJS, because NodeJS allows us to run JS, outside of the browser.

TERMINAL
--------
npm init -y <------------- *
... this gives us a package.json file, ...
... we need to install thrid-party packages.

TERMINAL
--------
npm install redux

... now we're ready to use Redux ...

redux-demo.js
-------------
const redux = require("redux"); <---------- the default NodeJS import syntax for importing a thrid party package.

... we'll need to create store, a reducer function (which changes that store), 
an action and a component (or since we're not using a React app yet), 
any other code that sets up a subscription to the store.

... it makes sense to start with the store, since, that is the central piece and concept of Redux.

const store = redux.legacy_createStore(); <----------- ... should manage some data
and the data which it manages, is in the end, determined by the reducer function, 
... it's the reducer function which will produce new state snapshots. <------------ *
The reducer has the goal of spliting out a new state snapshot whenever an action reaches it. <------------ *

... when we run this code for the first time, 
the reducer will also be executed with a default action, that should split out the initial state.

A reducer function is a standard JS function, but it will be called by the Redux library <------------- **
and it will then always receive two pieces of input, 
... the old or existing state and the action that was dispatched.
... this reducer function must return a certain output.
It must always return a new state object ... 
... should be a pure function. ... the same inputs always should produce exactly the same output.
... there should be no side effects inside of that function.

Reducer function <------- Should be a pure function <-- Same input always leads to the same output
input -------------------------------------> Output
Old state + Dispatched action             New state object

... we also need someone who subscribes to that store, and then we need an action that can be dispatched.
... subscriber, ... does not get any parameters, <--------- *
can reach out the store and call getState ... it will give us the latest state snapshot after it was updated ... <------- **

... this subscription function, will soon be triggered whenever the state changes. <-------- **
... when it is triggered, we can get to that latest state, after it was changed with the getState method ...
 
... make Redux aware of this subscriber function and tell it that this function should be executed whenever our state changes.
... store.subscriber(subscriber) ...

TERMINAL

node redux-demo.js

redux-demo.js
-------------
const redux = require("redux");

const reducer = (state = { counter : 0 } , action) => {
  return ({
    counter: state.counter + 1,
  });
}

const store = redux.legacy_createStore(reducer);

const subscriber = () => {
  const latestState = store.getState();
}

store.subscribe(subscriber); 
store.dispatch({ type: "INC" });

... both the reducer, as well as the subscriber function will be executed by Redux.
