Redux vs React Context
----------------------
Don't we have React context already?
... it also allows us to avoid prop chains ...
... and instead we can have a central place, our context and the context provider component which we use for managing state.
So why do we need Redux?

React context has some potential disadvantages
Potential problem: deeply nested providers
Potential problem: high-frequency changes

Complex setup & management
--------------------------
In more complex apps, using React context can lead to deeply nested or fat context provider components

Performance
-----------
React context is not optimized for high-frequency state changes <---------- *
... context is great for low-frequency updates like changing a theme, or maybe also authentication, ...
