Providing The Store
-------------------
To provide our Redux store to the React app, ...

main.jsx  <---------- Where we rendered the entire app, 
--------              the highest level we can go in our React application, ... top of our component tree.
...
import { Provider } from "react-redux"; <----- This is actually a component.

... 
root.render( <----------- Where we render the root component.
  <Provider>
    <App />
  </Provider>
);

... just by wrapping Provider around App, we're not telling React-Redux (and React therefore), which store we wanna provide.

import store from "./store/index"; <--------------- We have to import our store 
...
<Provider store={store}>
  <App />
</Provider>

... now our components in this App, (the App component and any other child components) can tap into that store.
They can get data out of the store, they can set up a subscription to that data ... dispatch actions ...
