Creating a Redux Store for React
--------------------------------
... store your Redux related code files, in a store folder in the source folder.

store/index.js
--------------
import { createStore } from "redux"; <-------- ... pull out specific things from the Redux library, ...
...
const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {} <------- ... a default value, so that when the reducer is executed
                                                              for the first time, we have an initial state.

const store = createStore(reducer) <----------- createStore wants a pointer at a reducer function as a parameter

export default store;

... I wanna connect my React app to this Redux store, so that the components of this app can dispatch and listen.
... we need to provide this store to the React app.
... we only have one Redux store, we only need to provide our store once, ... what does provide mean?
