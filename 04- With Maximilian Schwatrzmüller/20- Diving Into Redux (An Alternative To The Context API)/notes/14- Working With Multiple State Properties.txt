Working With Multiple State Properties
--------------------------------------
... we need to add a new state (a new piece of data) to our Redux store.
How do we now do that?
... go to our reducer ...

store/reducer.js
----------------
...
const initialState = { counter: 0, showCounter: true };

const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  const { type, payload = 1 } = action;

  switch (type) {
    case Types.inc: {
      return {
        counter: state.counter + payload,
        showCounter: state.showCounter,
      };
    }

... Redux won't merge your changes with the existing state.
It instead takes what you return and replaces the existing state with it. <----------- **

... in Counter, we again call useSelector.
We can use this, multiple times, to retrieve different pieces of data from the state.

Counter.jsx
-----------
...
const showCounter = useSelector(state => state.showCounter);
