Redux with Class-based Components
---------------------------------
... how this Counter component would look like if we would build it as a class-based component.

... how do we get access to Redux here?

... React-Redux also exports a connect function, which is a function that helps you connect class-based components to Redux.
... you could also use it on functional components, ...
When we export our Counter ... instead call connect and now connect when executed,
will actually return a new function as a value, ... connect is a higher order component. <---------- **

Counter.js
----------
import { Component } from "react";
...
class Counter extends Component {
  ...
  incHandler() {
    this.props.increment();
  }

  render() {
    return ...
  }
}

...
export default connect()(Counter); <----------------- * 

... connect also wants some arguments. ... two arguments and both arguments are functions.
The first function is a function that maps Redux state to props, which will be received in this component (Counter component).

const mapStateToProps = state => { <------- return an object where the keys will be available 
  return {                                  as props in the receiving component (Counter component).
    counter: state.counter <---- Bind state.counter to the counter prop.
  };
}

The second argument ... the idea is to store dispatch functions in props.
... in the Counter component, we have certain props ... dispatch an action to the Redux store.

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => { <---- Will be executed for you by Redux
  return {
    increment: () => dispatch({ type: "INC" }); <------- Keys are prop names which we can then use in the component
  }
}
... this ensures that in the Counter component, we'll have an increment prop which we can use. <------------ ***

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter); 

... when using connect, React-Redux will still set up a subscription and manage the subsription for you. <----------- **
... in the Counter component, we'll have an increment prop ...
