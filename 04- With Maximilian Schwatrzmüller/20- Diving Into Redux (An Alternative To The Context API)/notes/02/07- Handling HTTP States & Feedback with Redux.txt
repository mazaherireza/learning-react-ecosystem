Handling HTTP States & Feedback with Redux
------------------------------------------
... handle the response and potential errors, ... the Notification component ...

App.jsx
-------
...
  useEffect(() => {
    const sendCartData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch(`${URL}/cart.json`,
      {
        method: "PUT",
        body: JSON.stringify(cart),
      }

    if(!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Sending cart data failed!");
    }

    const responseData = await response.json();
  }
}, [cart];

... show Notification ... since we already have a UI slice (in Redux), why not use that?

... now we have the notification right from the start when I reload.
... initially sends a ... request ... there's a cart request being sent to Firebase
... of course we don't wanna send the cart ... right at the beginning ... always override out existing cart 
on the backend with an empty cart when the app loads.
... in App.jsx ... we don't send ... when this runs for the first time.
