Redux & Async Code
------------------
... how we can connect Redux with side effects and asynchronous code.
I wanna send a request to a backend server ...

To follow along, you can simply create a new Firebase project and use the "Realtime DB" in "Test Mode".

... such code must not go into our reducer functions so we can't send our HTTP request inside of the reducers ...
... don't perform a side effect inside of your reducer, no matter if it's synchronous or asynchronous, ... <--------------- **

Where should side-effects & aysnc tasks be executed?
Inside the components 
Inside the action creators
