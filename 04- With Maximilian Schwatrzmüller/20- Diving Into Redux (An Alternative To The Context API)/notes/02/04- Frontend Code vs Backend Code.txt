Frontend Code vs Backend Code
-----------------------------
... running the async code, (the side effect) inside of our components.

ProductItem.jsx
---------------
...
  const handleAddToCart = () => {
    dispatch(cartActions.addItem({ ...product }));
  };

... not just dispatch an action to our Redux store but we could also send that data to Firebase (to the backend).
... we would just store that product data in Firebase, ... does not have any logic on its own on the backend.
... on the Firebase backend we don't run any extra code.
So if we send some product data there, that product data would simply be added to the DB but all the logic we have in the reducer ...
... does not run on Firebase, ...

... the code we need to write on the frontend and where we write that code will depend on our backend code.
... backend API, (backend server) talking to our frontend application with help of the HTTP requests ...

Frontend React App ---------------> Send data & receive + use response
                                    (i.e. less code on the frontend, ahead of the reducer)
Backend API ----------------------> Does a lot of work            
                                    (i.e, transforms data + stores data)

Backend API ---------> Does not a lot of work
Firebase               (i.e. just stores incoming data)

Frontend React App ---> Transform data & send data
                        (i.e. more code on the frontend, ahead of the reducer)
