Where To Put Our Logic
----------------------
... we can also use useSelector from react-redux, ... do all that transformation (which we do in the reducer)
inside of ProductItem component without mutating the state <---------- ** 
and then we send the request.

ProductItem.js
--------------
...
  const handleAddToCart = () => {
   ...
  };

... without making Redux aware of it, because I would be changing it outside of a reducer function ...
... you must never mutate Redux state and especially don't do it outside of a reducer <------------ **

What's the problem with this approach though?
... if we would use this in all the parts of our application, where we need to update the cart ... copy all that logic ...
... outsource it into an extra file which exports a function ... still we have another problem,
We do the data transformation in some helper function ... we don't do the transformation in our reducers
... that means our Redux reducers wouldn't do a lot of work, they'd just get some data and store it.
... it's not the main idea behind using Redux ...

... when it comes to the question of where to put our code, we often have the choice among: 
Fat Reducers vs fat components vs fat actions
Where should your logic (code) go?

... we have to, differentiate between synchronous ...

[Synchronous, side-effect free code 
(i.e., data transformations)]

Prefer reducers
Avoid action creators or components

[Async code or code with side-effects]

Prefer action creators or components
Never use reducers!
