Using An Action Creator, Thunk
------------------------------
... we can also write our own action creators ...

What is a Thunk?
A thunk is simply a function, that delays an action until later, (until something else finished). <------------ **
... does not immediately return the action object, 
... instead, returns another function which eventually returns the action. <------------ **

An action creator function, that does not return the action itself but instead another function which eventually returns the action.

... so that we can run some other code, before we then dispatch the actual action object, that we did wanna create.

cart-slice.js
-------------
import { uiActions } from "./ui-slice";
...
<------- outside of this slice
export const cartThunk = (cart) => {
  <--------- ... we could write this (cartThunk) as an action creator, by returning an action object in here.
  return { type: "TYPE", payload: "PAYLOAD" }
}

... we never did this ourselves, because Redux Toolkit, creates these action creators automatically for us, <----------- **
for all reducer methods.

Every method in the reducer object, receives such an action creator, which is called by using that reducer function name.

... returns another function.

const cartThunk = (cart) => {
  return (dispatch) => {
    dispatch(); <------- dispatch the actual action we wanna perform
  }
}
... before we call dispatch, we can of course do other things, ... we can perform any asynchronous code,
any side effects ... it's a separate standalone JS function ...

I wanna use cartThunk as an action creator ...

App.jsx
-------
import { cartThunk } from "./store/cart-slice";
...
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isInitial) {
      isInitial = false;
      return;
    }
    dispatch(cartThunk(cart));
  }, [cart]);
...

... it's an alternative to having that logic in your component.
