Another Look At State In React Apps
-----------------------------------
Redux is a state mangement system for cross-component or app-wide state <------------ **
... it helps us manage state, data which, when changed, should affect the UI

... we use React's state management hooks like useState so that we can tell React
that some data changed and so that it then updates the UI for us.

We can split the definition of state into three main kinds of state.
What is cross-component & app-wide state? <----------- *

1) Local State   
State belongs to a single component
E.g., listening to user input on an input filed 
or toggling a "Show More Details" field

Should be managed inside the component via useState() / useReducer

2) Cross-component State   
State affecting multiple components 
E.g., open / closed state of a modal overlay

Requires "prop drilling"

3) App-wide State
State affecting the entire app
E.g., user authentication status or chosen theme

Requires "prop drilling"
