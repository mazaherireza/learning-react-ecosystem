How Redux Works
---------------
Core Redux Concepts

... Redux is all about having one central data store in your application. <------------ *
                              
                               Subscription
Central Data (State) Store ---------------------> Components
... you have exactly one store.

... they subscribe to the store, and whenever the data changes, the store notifies components, 
and then components can get the data they need, ... they get a slice of the Redux store, and they can then use it.

... components never directly manipulate the store data.
so we have the subscription but we don't have a data flow in the other direction.
... we have a reducer function.
... is responsible for mutating the store data.
