Why Do You Need A Special Project Setup
----------------------------------------
Wy do we need ... a local project, created with extra tools like Vite ... ?
Why can't we just create an HTML file and a JS file 
and reference the script file from inside the HTML file and then put our React code into that script file?
... it isn't really an option, ... you'll use this special HTML in JS ... this syntax is called JSX
... doesn't work in the browser so therefore the code you write actually must be transformed
to code that does run in the browser ... you typically want to optimize this code ...
so that the code that has to be downloaded by your website visitors is as small as possible
to improve the performance of your website ... that's the reason why you need to create React projects 
with extra tools like Vite ... those tools which do transform your code to code that can be executed efficiently 
in the browser.

app.js
------
function Comp = () => <h3>Does it work?</h3> <---------- HTML in JS (JSX)

React Code Must Be Transformed!
______________________________
React Code
JS code that typically uses JSX (HTML in JS)

Code is transformed & optimized (e.g., unnecessary whitespaces is removed)

Code that runs in the browser
JS code without JSX

Handled by build tool (e.g., Vite) <-------------- **
That's why a "more complex" project setup (which includes such a build tool) is needed.
